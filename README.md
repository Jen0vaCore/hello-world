My Hello World Repository

Hello everyone. I'm Jen0vaCore and a bit new to the programming scene. I started with C++ and learned the core of it, and now am moving on to libraries, STL, and other parts of the language.

I eventually hope to also learn C, Java, C# (.NET and MONO), Python, and LUA at some point as well so I am well rounded in programming.

My goal of programming in general is to learn and create software development, graphical applications, network/server development, and game development. That is my ultimate goal for programming at this current time.
